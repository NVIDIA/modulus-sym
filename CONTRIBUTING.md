## Introduction

Welcome to Project Modulus! We're excited you're here and want to contribute. This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to Modulus. Modulus is an open-source project and, as such, its success relies on its community of contributors willing to keep improving it. Your contribution will be a valued addition to the code base; we simply ask that you read this page and understand our contribution process, whether you are a seasoned open-source contributor or whether you are a first-time contributor.

### Communicate with us
We are happy to talk with you about your needs for Modulus and your ideas for contributing to the project. One way to do this is to create an issue discussing your thoughts. It might be that a very similar feature is under development or already exists, so an issue is a great starting point. If you are looking for an issue to resolve that will help, refer to the [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/issues) section.


## Contribute to Modulus-Sym

### Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [upstream](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Modulus) Modulus repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) (PR) can be [requested](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
  * Exercise caution when selecting the source and target branches for the PR.
  * Creation of a PR creation kicks off CI and a code review process.
  * Atleast one Modulus engineer will be assigned for the review.

4. The PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed after adequate review and testing has been completed.

### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
