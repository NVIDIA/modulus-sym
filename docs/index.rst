NVIDIA Modulus is a deep learning framework that blends the power of 
physics and partial differential equations (PDEs) with AI to build more 
robust models for better analysis. 

There is a plethora of ways in which ML/NN models can be applied for 
physics-based systems. These can depend based on the availability of 
observational data and the extent of understanding of underlying physics. 
Based on these aspects, the ML/NN based methodologies can be broadly 
classified into forward (physics-driven), data-driven and hybrid approaches 
that involve both the physics and data assimilation.

With NVIDIA Modulus, we aim to provide researchers and industry specialists, 
various tools that will help accelerate your development of such models for the 
scientific discipline of your need. Experienced users can start with exploring the 
Modulus APIs and building the models while beginners can use this User Guide 
as a portal to explore the possibilities of AI in the domain of scientific 
computation. The User Guide comes in with several examples that will help 
you jumpstart your development of AI driven models.
