# This script allows you to try various combinations of Modulus
# features by changing only this config.yaml file. For best
# performance, we recommend the below defaults for each architecture.
# You can modify them by editing the  correponding entries in this

# WARNING: Setting "exact_continuity" to true or setting the arch
# as "ModifiedFourierNetArch" increases the memory requirements of the 
# problem. Batchsizes may need to be reduced for such cases.
