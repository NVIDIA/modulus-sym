# This script allows you to try various combinations of Modulus
# features by changing only this config.yaml file. For best
# performance, we recommend the below defaults for each architecture.
# You can modify them by editing the  correponding entries in this 
# file
# Arch	                        Start Lr	Max Steps	Decay Steps 
# FullyConnectedArch	        1.00E-03	800000	        8000
# FourierNetArch                1.00E-03	400000	        4000
# ModifiedFourierNetArch	1.00E-03	400000	        4000
# SirenArch                     2.00E-05	500000	        5000
# DGMArch                       1.00E-03        800000          8000

# IMPORTANT: Please ensure you use the same network architecture and configs 
# for flow and heat. A mismatch will cause errors in initialization of the 
# flow checkpoint/solution. 

# WARNING: Setting "exact_continuity" to true or setting the arch
# as "ModifiedFourierNetArch" increases the memory requirements of the 
# problem. Batchsizes may need to be reduced for such cases.
