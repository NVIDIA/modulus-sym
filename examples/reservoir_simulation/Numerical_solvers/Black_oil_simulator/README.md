# [GPU accelerated Reservoir Simulator](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/GlobalEnergyTeam/simulation/gpu_black_oil_reservoir_simulation)


### Forward problem
**Black oil model**;

 - Our simplified model for two-phase flow in porous media for reservoir simulation is given as [7].
```math
\begin{equation}
φ\frac{∂S_w}{∂t} - \nabla .[T_{w} (\nabla.p_{w} + ρ_{w}gk)]= Q_{w} 
\end{equation}
```
```math
\begin{equation}
φ\frac{∂S_o}{∂t}- \nabla .[T_{o} (\nabla.p_{o} + ρ_{o} gk)]= Q_{o}     
\end{equation}
```
$`φ(x)`$ stands for the porosity,subscript $`w`$ stands for water and subscript $`o`$ stands for oil. $`T_{o},T_{w},T`$ stands for the transmissibilities, which are known functions of the permeability $`K`$ and the water saturation $`S_w`$. The system is closed by adding two additional equations

```math
\begin{equation}
P_{cwo} = p_o- p_w  ; S_w+ S_o=1. 
\end{equation}
``` 
This gives four unknowns
```math
\begin{equation}
p_{o}, p_{w}, S_{w}, S_{o}
\end{equation}
``` 
Gravity effects are considered by the terms 
```math
\begin{equation}
ρ_{w}gk,ρ_{o}gk\quad Ω \subset R^{n}(n = 2, 3) 
\end{equation}
``` 
The subsequent water, oil and overall transmissibilities is given by,
```math
\begin{equation} 
T_w = \frac{K(x) K_{rw}S_w}{μ_w}  ;T_o = \frac{K(x) K_{ro}S_o}{μ_o}   ;T= T_w + T_o          
\end{equation}
``` 
The relative permeabilities $`K_{rw} (S_w ),K_{ro} (S_w )`$ are available as tabulated functions, and $`μ_w,μ_o`$ denote the viscosities of each phase. 

We define the oil flow, the water flow, and the total flow, respectively, which are measured at the well position as; 
```math
\begin{equation} 
Q = Q_{o}  + Q_{w }
\end{equation}
``` 

The final pressure and saturation equations for a two-phase oil-water flow is
```math
\begin{equation} 
- ∇ .[T∇p]=Q   
\end{equation}
```  
```math
\begin{equation}                                               
φ\frac{∂S_w}{∂t} - \nabla .[T_{w} (\nabla.p_{w}]= Q_{w} 
\end{equation}
```

## Important Dependencies & Prerequisites:
- Nvidia's in-house GPU based black oil reservoir simulator - **NVRS**
- CUDA 11.8 : [link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
- CuPy : [link](https://github.com/cupy/cupy.git)
- Python 3.8 upwards

## Getting Started:
- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
- The code is developed in a Linux enviroment.

## Installation

- From terminal create a new conda enviroment named **MDLO** (check if conda is installed) .
```bash
conda create --name MDLO python=3.8
```

Clone this code base repository in a dedicated **work folder**.
```bash
cd **work folder**
conda activate MDLO
git clone https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/GlobalEnergyTeam/simulation/gpu_black_oil_reservoir_simulation.git

```
- From terminal, install (missing) dependencies in 'requirements.txt' in the conda enviroment **MDLO**
- Follow instructions to install CuPy from : [link](https://github.com/cupy/cupy.git)

```bash
# enable shell script execution.
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/docker/docker-build.sh
# Build docker image
./scripts/docker/docker-build.sh

# enable shell script execution.
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/docker/docker-run.sh
# Run docker container (also enables X server for docker)
./scripts/docker/docker-run.sh
```

### Run
**NVRS** is a fully GPU based Black oil reservoir simulator.
Solvers include;
1) Left-Preconditioned GMRES [link](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupyx.scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres.html)
2) LSQR [link](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupyx.scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr.html)
3) Left Preconditoned Conjugate gradient [link](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupyx.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg.html)
4) Constrained pressure residual -CPR  (V cycle 2stage AMG for presure solve and left-precondioned GMRES with ILU(0) as preconditoner for saturation sole) [link](https://doi.org/10.2118/96809-MS)
6) Spsolve [link](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupyx.scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve.html)


**CPR is the default solver**.
1) Pressure solver: V cycle 2 stage AMG with Aggregation and Level scheduling for the coarsening/restriction operations
2) Saturation solver:  Left preconditoned GMRES with ILU(0) as preconditioner
3) Smoothers include : Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR
