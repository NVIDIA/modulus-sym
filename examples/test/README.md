# Running experiments

This directory contains scripts to launch and train various examples to test convergence and generate reports. The experiments can be run with the script `run_experiments.py`. This script requires the `mode` and `gpus` to be specified. There are 3 run modes possible,

- `--mode=full`, This will run all examples to completion.
- `--mode=single_step`, This will run all examples for 100 iterations.
- `--mode=unit_tests`, This will run a select set of examples to check.


For example, the command to run all of the unit tests on gpus with ID 0 and 1 is.
```
python run_experiments.py --mode=unit_tests --gpus=0,1
```

NOTE, before running experiments please install quadpy with the command `pip install quadpy GPUtil gdown`. This library is not included in the docker image for technical reasons.


# Checking Convergence
Convergence can be checked for the `unit_tests` experiments by running the script,
```
python run_ci_tests.py
```

This will generate plots in the created folder `./checks` for inspecting convergence. It will also print convergence information and run times on screen.
