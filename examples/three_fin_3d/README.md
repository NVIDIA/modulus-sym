# PINNs as parameterized surrogate model for Heat Sink design optimization 

This example uses PINNs to create a parameterized surrogate model that can be used to explore the design space of certain design parameters to identify an optimal design. 

## Problem overview
This sample illustrates the capabilities in Modulus Sym to specify a paramterized geometry of a 3-fin heat sink whose fin height, fin thickness, and fin length are variable. It illustrates use of the CSG module to construct a parameterized geometry and then to use the trained surrogate to explore the design space for a range of values of the fin height, fin thickness, and fin length.
You can get more details on this sample from the [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-sym-v110/user_guide/advanced/parametrized_simulations.html)

## Dataset

This example does not require any dataset as it solves of the Navier Stokes flow using the equations, the physical geometry and the boundary conditions.

## Model overview and architecture

This is a multi-physics problem where we have to emulate both the flow and heat tranfer. This example has three neural networks - one for emulating the flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, one for heat transfer in the fluid for Advection diffusion and one for heat transfer in the solid due to diffusion. We use a simple fully connected MLP for all three networks.

## Getting Started

To train, simply run

```bash
python three_fin_flow.py
python three_fin_thermal.py
```
To infer in a design exploration loop

```bash
python three_fin_design.py
```
