    Wave equation 1D
    The equation is given as an example for implementing
    your own PDE. A more universal implementation of the
    wave equation can be found by
    `from modulus.sym.eq.pdes.wave_equation import WaveEquation`.

    Parameters
    ==========
    c : float, string
        Wave speed coefficient. If a string then the
        wave speed is input into the equation.
